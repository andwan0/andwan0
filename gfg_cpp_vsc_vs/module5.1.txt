Stack and Queue Operations

You are given an array A of size N. You need to push the elements of the array into a stack and then print them while popping. Also do the same for a queue.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line of input contains size of array N. The second line of array contains the elements of array separated by spaces.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Ai <= 107

Examples:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
7
1 6 43 1 2 0 5
Output:
5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5
5 0 2 1 43 6 1
1 6 43 1 2 0 5

We first push all elements to stack, then pop. Since stack follows LIFO, we get 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  We then enqueue these to a queue, then dequeue them one by one. Since queue follows FIFO, we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
