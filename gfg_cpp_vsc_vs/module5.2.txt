Pattern Printer - CPP

You are given a string S that need to be printed in a specific form. Example: FORKJAVA will be printed as FAOVRAKJ.

Input Format:
The first line of testcase contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains only one line of input containing S.

Output Format:
For each test case, in a new line, print the string in the given form.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function patternPrint that takes a queue of characters. These characters are obtained by enqueing the characters of S into the queue.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= |S| <= 1000
