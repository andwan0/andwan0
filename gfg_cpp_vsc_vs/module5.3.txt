Prioritized Students

Given some student data as their name and marks, and given Q queries.The task is to insert these student's data into the priority_queue or return required element from the priority_queue based on the query.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, there will be Q queries. The task is to perform operation based on the queries, as below:
1. i : means insert student data into the queue
2. o : means return student data with max marks, tie break with lexicographically larger name.

Output:
For each testcase, print the required top student data as name and marks from the priority queue. If priority_queue is empty, return (empty, -1) as pair elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 103
1 <= marks <= 106

User Task:
Your task is to complete the functions insert() and maxFromQueue() which should insert the element into the queue and return top data from the queue respectively.

ankit 200
baba 150

empty -1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: parul and ankit is having maximum marks till now but parul is lexicographically larger than ankit, so it is returned. Similarly other operations are also performed.
