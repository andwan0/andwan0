You are given an array A of size N. All the elements of A, except one element, occur twice. You need to find the element that doesn't have its duplicate in A.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T, the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the array. The second line contains N elements of A separated by spaces.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the element that occurs single time in A. If no such elements exists then print -1.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to read any input. Just complete the provided function findLoner.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 500
1<= N <= 107
1 <= Ai <= 1018
