Volume of Cuboid

You are given l, b, h of a cuboid. Find the volume.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains single line of input containing l, b,h separated by spaces.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the volume of the cuboid.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you need to just complete the function volume(Cuboid c) that takes a cuboid object.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= l,b,h <= 1000

Example:
Input:
1
1 2 3
Output:
6

Explanation:
Testcase1: l=1, b= 2, h =3. l*b*h=1*2*3=6
