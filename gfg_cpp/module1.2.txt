Given a number N. The task is to print word accordring to the directions given below:
1. If N is divisible by 3, print "Fork" (without quotes).
2. If N is divisible by 5, print "CPP" (without quotes).
3. If N is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "Fork CPP" (without quotes).|
4. If N ia neither divisible by 3 nor 5, print nothing.

Input Format:
First line of input contains number of testcases. For each testcase, there will be only single line of input which contains N.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print string as required.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem, you only need to complete the function forkCPP(). We will take care of rest.

Examples:
Input:
3
3
5
15

Output:
Fork
CPP
Fork CPP

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 3 is only divisible by 3. So, ouput is Fork.
Testcase 3: 15 is divisible by 3 and 5 both. So, ouput is Fork CPP.
