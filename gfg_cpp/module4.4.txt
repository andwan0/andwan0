Frequency Major Elements

Given a vector of N integers. The task is to sort the vector according to the frequency of elements. If two numbers is having same frequency, sort on the basis of element itself.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line contains number of elements in vector. Second line contains the elements of vector.

Output:
For each testcase, print the elements with its frequency.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= V[i] <= 1015

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function sortWithFrequency() which should return the vector of pairs, containing element as first element of the pair and its frequency as second element of pair.

Example:
Input:
1
19
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 4 3 2 5 5 3

Output:
3 5 4 5 5 5 2 3 1 1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Frequency of 3 is 5, frequency of 4 is 5, frequency of 5 is 5, that of 2 is 3 and of 1 is 1.
