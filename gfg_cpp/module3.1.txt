Given an array A of positive integers of size N. The task is to find the first two odd elements in array. It is guarantee that array elements are continuous as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... , N] and first element is odd.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcase T. For each testcase, first line contains N (size of array), next line contains N positive integers.

Output:
For each testcase, print the count of odd elements in the array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
1
5
3 4 5 6 7

Output:
3 5

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Out of the array elements, 3 and 5 are first two odd numbers.
