Add Vector Elements

ou are given a vector of size n. Add the elements of the vector

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains n. The second line of each testcase contains n elements of the vector(vi).

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the sum .

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function vectorAdd that takes a vector as input.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1<= n<= 106
0 <= vi <= 100

Examples:
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
15
