Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is r and c, r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. The second line of each test case contains all the elements of the matrix in a single line separated by a single space.

Output Format:
Print the modified array.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to read any input. Just complete the provided function makeThemOne.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 102
1 ≤ r, c ≤ 103
0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 1

Example:
Input:
3
2 2
1 0
0 0
2 3
0 0 0 
0 0 1
3 4
1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 
0 0 0 0

Output:
1 1
1 0
0 0 1 
1 1 1
1 1 1 1 
1 1 1 1 
1 0 1 1

Explanation:
Testcase1: Since only first element of matrix has 1 (at index 0,0) as value, so first row and first column are modified to 1.
