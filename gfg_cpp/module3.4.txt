Diagonal Sum

Given a 2D array A[ ][ ] of N positive integers. Your task is to find the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcase T. For each testcase, first line contains N and next N line contains N positive integers.

Output:
For each testcase, print the sum of diagonal elements.

User task:
Your task is to complete the function diagonalSum() which returns the sum of diagonal elements of matrix.

Example:
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
4 0 6
7 8 9

Output:
20

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Sum of elements of diagonals of matrix is 10 (1 + 0 + 9 + 7 + 3).
