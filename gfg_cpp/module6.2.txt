Strings Frequency

You are given an array A of size N. The array contains strings of lowercase characters. Now, you have to find strings and their frequency in lexiographically order.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T, denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input.  The first line of input contains size of array N. The second line contains N strings separated by spaces.

Output Format:
For each test case, in a new line, print the required answer.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function frequency(arr, n) that takes an array and size as input and returns a multiset.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100

Examples:
Input:
1
5
geeks abcd hello world geeks
Output:
abcd 1
geeks 2
hello 1
world 1
