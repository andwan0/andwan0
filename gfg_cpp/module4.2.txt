Vector Common Elements

You are given two sorted vectors of size n and m. You need to find the common elements.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains n and m separated by a space. The second line of each testcase contains n elements of first vector. The next line contains m elements of second vector. The elements of the vectors are denoted by vi.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the common elements in a sorted order. If no common elements exist then print Empty.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function commonElements that takes two vectors as input and returns a third vector(with common elements) as output.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1<= n, m <= 106
0 <= vi <= 107

Examples:
Input:
2
5 6
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6 7 8
1 2
1
3 4
Output:
3 4 5
Empty
